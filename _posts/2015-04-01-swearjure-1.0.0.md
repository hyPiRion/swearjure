I am happy to announce the first version of Swearjure, version 1.0.0. If you
have a recent version of [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) installed, you
can build Swearjure by doing the following commands in your favourite terminal:

{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://github.com/hypirion/swearjure.git
cd swearjure
git checkout 1.0.0
cabal sandbox init
cabal install
cp .cabal-sandbox/bin/swearjure swearjure
# and we're ready to go!
./swearjure
{% endhighlight %}

If you have `~/.cabal/bin` on your path, you can also attempt to do

{% highlight bash %}
cabal update && cabal install swearjure
{% endhighlight %}

The source code is available at <https://github.com/hyPiRion/swearjure>.

## What is Swearjure?

The *language* Swearjure is the subset of Clojure without alphanumeric
characters. The *program* Swearjure is an implementation of Clojure that
enforces those constraints.

If you wonder how you can program anything sensible without alphanumerics in
Clojure, there are several introductions. Gary Fredericks presented Swearjure in
[his lightning talk](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/swearjure) at
Clojure/West some years ago, and I wrote a
[blogpost](http://hypirion.com/musings/swearjure) about it as well.

Swearjure is turing complete[^1], so you can in theory convert any program to
Swearjure. This is a bit easier said than done, though.

### Notable Differences from Clojure

- No alphanumerics
- Fast startup!
- Strict (no laziness)
- Interpreted, not compiled
- "Tail recursion"

Pure Swearjure programs can only print the last expression in the file they are
executing. For convenience, the Swearjure implementation therefore ships with
the functions `>>`, `>>'` and `<<'`, that allows you to read and print values.
See the [I/O section][io] in the tutorial for more information.

## Learn Swearjure

The
[Swearjure tutorial](https://github.com/hyPiRion/swearjure/blob/master/doc/tutorial.md)
has good documentation on how to get started with Swearjure. It will learn you
basic Swearjure, and the thought process used to convert more complex Clojure
programs into Swearjure.

For more experienced users, there is also a document on
[extra tricks](https://github.com/hyPiRion/swearjure/blob/master/doc/extra-tricks.md).
For example, it shows how you can implement random number generation in this
Swearjure implementation.

## Example Programs

Swearjure programs look just like Clojure programs, except that they have no
alphanumeric characters in them. Functions do look somewhat obscure, mostly
because they can only be defined through clever use of `->>`, `->` and `#()`.

### Hello World

This is one way of implementing a program printing out "Hello World!" in
Swearjure:

{% highlight clojure %}
((->>
  (>>' (- $ ! (/ (- ++) (+ (*) (*))))
       (+ $ (*))
       (+ $ ++)
       (+ $ ++)
       (+ $ (#(* % (+ % % %)) (+ (*) (*))) (- (*)))
       !
       (- (+ $ !) (*) (#(* % (+ % % %)) (+ (*) (*))))
       (+ $ (#(* % (+ % % %)) (+ (*) (*))) (- (*)))
       (+ $ (#(* % (+ (*) % % %)) (+ (*) (*))))
       (+ $ ++)
       $
       (+ ! (*))
       (#(* % (+ (*) % %)) (+ (*) (*))))
  #()
  (-> [$ ++ !]))
 (#(* % % (+ (*) (* % %)) (+ (*) (* % %))) (+ (*) (*)))
 (#(* % % %) (+ (*) (*)))
 (#(* % % % % %) (+ (*) (*))))
{% endhighlight %}

This code generates three big numbers (the last 3 lines) and feeds it into an
anonymous function. The anonymous function then combines these numbers to form
all the integer values corresponding to the string `"Hello World!"`, which is
then sent to the printing function `>>'`

### Cat

{% highlight clojure %}
((->> (>=>)
      #(>>' (<<'))
      (-> >=>)))
{% endhighlight %}

This program works like `cat` without any arguments. It takes in a single
character (represented as an integer value) and prints it out again. Afterwards
it calls itself. In contrast to Clojure proper, Swearjure implements "tail
recursion", so the stack is not consumed on tail calls.

The only thing that breaks the illusion that this is `cat` itself is that it
spits out the error `swearjure: <stdin>: hGetChar: end of file` when EOF is
received.
