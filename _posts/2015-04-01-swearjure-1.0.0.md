I am happy to announce the first version of Swearjure, version 1.0.0. If you
have a recent version of [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) installed, you
can build Swearjure by doing the following commands in your favourite terminal:

{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://github.com/hypirion/swearjure.git
cd swearjure
cabal sandbox init
cabal install
cp .cabal-sandbox/bin/swearjure swearjure
# and we're ready to go!
./swearjure
{% endhighlight %}

The source code is available at <https://github.com/hyPiRion/swearjure>.

## What is Swearjure?

The *language* Swearjure is the subset of Clojure without alphanumeric
characters. The *program* Swearjure is an implementation of Clojure that
enforces those constraints.

If you wonder how you can program anything sensible without alphanumerics in
Clojure, there are several introductions. Gary Fredericks presented Swearjure in
[his lightning talk](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/swearjure) at
Clojure/West some years ago, and I wrote a
[blogpost](http://hypirion.com/musings/swearjure) about it as well.

Swearjure is turing complete[^1], so you can in theory convert any program to
Swearjure. This is a bit easier said than done, though.

### Notable Differences from Clojure

- No alphanumerics
- Fast startup!
- Strict (no laziness)
- Interpreted, not compiled
- "Tail recursion"

Pure Swearjure programs can only print the last expression in the file they are
executing. For convenience, the Swearjure implementation therefore ships with
the functions `>>`, `>>'`, `<<` and `<<'`, that allows you to read and print
values. See the [I/O section][io] in the tutorial for more information.

## Example Programs

### Hello World

{% highlight clojure %}
((->>
  (>>' (- $ ! (/ (- ++) (+ (*) (*))))
       (+ $ (*))
       (+ $ ++)
       (+ $ ++)
       (+ $ (#(* % (+ % % %)) (+ (*) (*))) (- (*)))
       !
       (- (+ $ !) (*) (#(* % (+ % % %)) (+ (*) (*))))
       (+ $ (#(* % (+ % % %)) (+ (*) (*))) (- (*)))
       (+ $ (#(* % (+ (*) % % %)) (+ (*) (*))))
       (+ $ ++)
       $
       (+ ! (*))
       (#(* % (+ (*) % %)) (+ (*) (*))))
  #()
  (-> [$ ++ !]))
 (#(* % % (+ (*) (* % %)) (+ (*) (* % %))) (+ (*) (*)))
 (#(* % % %) (+ (*) (*)))
 (#(* % % % % %) (+ (*) (*))))
{% endhighlight %}
